    "# To solve a busniess problem you need to have historical data.\n",
    "# Typicall data comes from various sources, your first job at hand is to procure the data from private and public sources.\n",
    "# There are two kinds of data\n",
    "# 1) Public Data:\n",
    "# A large amount of data collected by the government or other public agencies is made public for the purposes of research. Such data sets do not require special permission for access and are therefore called public data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2) Private Data:\n",
    "# On the other hand, private data is that which is sensitive to organisations and is thus not available in the public domain. Banking, telecom, retail, and media are some of the key private sectors that rely heavily on data to make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of EDA:\n",
    "# 1) HR-Industry:\n",
    "# Using data of past and current employee, you can predict which employee is planning to leave. Few characterstics of those will be the \n",
    "# no of sick leaves, no of stocks sold, If he is participating in extra curricular activity or not etc.\n",

    "# Similarly for hiring as well we can use EDA.\n",

    "# use of data in the banking, telecom and human resources sectors. \n",
    "# While banks use data to make credit related decisions, telecoms use data to optimise plans for customers and predict customer\n",

    "# Using retail data we can easily do Market-Basket Analaysis: like which product is most selling.\n",

    "# Market-Basket Analysis Use Case:\n",
    "# for a telecom company, using EDA we found out that the top up plans which are multiple of 100 are the most selling one.\n",
    "# like if a data plan is of 99 or 199 it was getting sold, but plans like 472 was not getting that much sale. \n",
    "# so company decided to start selling 28 rs tarrif so that shopkeeper doesn't need to return the exchange and consumer will buy small \n",

For e.g In a database “MLA” containing the details of MLAs throughout India, you have a city named Rampur in Himachal Pradesh, UP and Chhattisgarh. The city names are stored in the “City” column while state names are stored in the “State” column. What is the best way to represent the cities in this case? \n",
